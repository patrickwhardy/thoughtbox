Thoughtbox is a rails application for storing links for future use. The following features are built with JavaScript/jQuery/AJAX to occur without reloading the page:

- Mark a link as read or unread
- Filter the list of links by a search term
- Filter the list by status (e.g. "read" and "unread")
- Sort the list alphabetically
